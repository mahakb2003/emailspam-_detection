# emailspam-_detection
Email Spam Detection using Python and ML

'''Overview'''
This project focuses on building an Email Spam Detection system using Machine Learning techniques. The model utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to convert email text into numerical features and applies Logistic Regression to classify emails as spam or not spam.

'''Project Workflow'''
Data Preprocessing: Cleansing and preparing email text data.

Feature Extraction: Converting text into feature vectors using TfidfVectorizer.

Dataset Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Model Training: Implementing LogisticRegression for classification.

Evaluation: Measuring model accuracy using accuracy_score.

'''Tech Stack'''
Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

'''Use Cases'''

This model can be used for:
✔ Filtering spam emails
✔ Enhancing email security
✔ Automating email classification
